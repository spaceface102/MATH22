Topic: Introduction and proofs
In general a proof is:
    - a method for establishing and verifying (ascertain) truth
How do we ascertain truth?
    - observation (bedrock of physics)
    - sampling, counter examples
        i) doing something over and over, and if consensus, truth
            is established
    - judges, jury (they establish what is true or not)
    - religion, boss, professor: any source of authority
In Mathematics, mathematical proofs are:
    - a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions
        from a set of axioms
    - The key three things from the definition:
        i) proposition
        ii) logical deductions
        iii) axioms

Def proposition: is a statement that is either true or false
    - you may not know which one but is one or the other
    - ex: 2 + 3 = 5
    - ex: for all n in the set of natural numbers, n ^ 2 + n + 41 is a prime number
        i) this is false

n ^ 2 + n + 41 is a prime number is a predicate
Def predicate: proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable
    - in a proposition predicate combo, in order of the proposition to be
        true, every instance of the predicate must be true
    
Def: implication p -> q is true if p == false || q == true
    - notice that anything that is false always implies anything
        as true!
    - I assume that p and q are predicates

Def Axiom: a proposition that is assumed to be true
    - there is No proof that an axiom is true, we just
        assume it is because we think its reasonable
        i) "axiom" comes from greek "think worthy"
Axioms should be:
    - consistent
    - complete
Def consistent: A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can
    be proved to be both True or false
    - you want each proposition that the axiom helps define as
        true of false to be one or the other; there is no point
        for something that is both true and false
Def complete: A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to prove
    that every proposition is either True or false
Kurt Godel's incompleteness theorem states that axioms can't be both
consistent and complete

Reasonably, we want consistency, but therefore, that means that there
are true facts that can never be proven.
    - ex Goldbach's conjecture maybe True, but it is impossible to prove
